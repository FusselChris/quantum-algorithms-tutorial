# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

*Note: As this is an educational quantum computing tutorial repository, we maintain security updates for the current stable version.*

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our quantum algorithms tutorial seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Process

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via:
- **Email**: Send details to the repository maintainer via GitHub's private messaging system
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Security" tab to privately report vulnerabilities
- **GitHub Issues**: For non-critical issues, you may create a private issue

### What to Include

Please include as much of the following information as possible:
- Type of issue (e.g., code injection, information disclosure, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- We will provide a more detailed response within 7 days indicating our next steps
- We will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement
- We may ask for additional information or guidance

### Security Considerations for Quantum Algorithms

This repository contains educational implementations of quantum algorithms. Please note:
- These implementations are for learning purposes and may not be production-ready
- Quantum cryptographic vulnerabilities should be reported with special attention to their implications
- Issues related to quantum key distribution or quantum-safe cryptography implementations are particularly important

Thank you for helping to keep our educational resources secure!
