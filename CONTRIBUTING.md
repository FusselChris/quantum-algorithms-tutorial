- **Educational content**: Better explanations, step-by-step tutorials
- **Test coverage**: More comprehensive test suites
- **Documentation**: API docs, usage examples, troubleshooting guides

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Code Structure

```python
def quantum_function(param: int) -> float:
    """
    Brief description of the function.
    
    Args:
        param: Description of the parameter
        
    Returns:
        Description of return value
        
    Raises:
        SpecificError: When this error occurs
    """
    # Implementation here
    return result
```

### Quantum Circuit Guidelines

- Use clear qubit and classical bit naming
- Add circuit comments for complex operations
- Optimize circuit depth when possible
- Include circuit visualization where helpful
- Document quantum gate choices and reasoning

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- All new code must include corresponding tests
- Aim for >90% test coverage
- Test both success and failure cases
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
   ```python
   def test_quantum_teleportation_success():
       teleporter = QuantumTeleportation()
       result = teleporter.teleport_state()
       assert result['success'] is True
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**: Test algorithm workflows
   ```python
   def test_grover_search_integration():
       grover = GroverSearch(n_qubits=3)
       result = grover.search([2, 5])
       assert len(result) == 2
   ```

3. **Property Tests**: Test mathematical properties
   ```python
   def test_quantum_fidelity_bounds():
       # Test that fidelity is always between 0 and 1
       pass
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_teleportation.py -v
```

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

- Use NumPy-style docstrings
- Document all parameters and return values
- Include usage examples in docstrings
- Explain quantum concepts for educational purposes

### README Updates

- Update installation instructions if dependencies change
- Add new algorithms to the features list
- Update usage examples for new functionality
- Maintain accurate directory structure documentation

### Jupyter Notebooks
